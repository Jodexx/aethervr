# AetherVR

AetherVR is a tool to run VR games/applications on PC without a VR headset. The system tracks your head and hands using
nothing but a webcam and translates the results into virtual headset and controller inputs that are passed on to VR
applications. This is done using a custom OpenXR runtime that tricks applications into thinking they are connected to
actual VR hardware.

> [!NOTE]
> The OpenXR runtime is incomplete and non-conformant and might crash with some applications.

## Setup

### System-Wide Installation

If you want to use AetherVR with standalone apps (e.g. from Steam), you can install it globally by setting AetherVR as
the system OpenXR runtime. Note that this will replace your previous OpenXR runtime (if you had one) and that all OpenXR
apps will use AetherVR from now on.

1. Run `aethervr_tracker.exe` as administrator
2. Click `Set AetherVR as OpenXR Runtime`
3. Run your VR application

To use your previous OpenXR runtime, open the settings of your VR vendor's app and look for a button that says something
like 'set myself as the active OpenXR runtime'.

### Unity Engine

If you don't want to change your OpenXR runtime globally, you can select AetherVR in Unity for use as the play mode
OpenXR runtime.

1. Make sure your graphics API is either Vulkan or D3D11
2. Go to `Edit > Project Settings > XR Plug-in Management > OpenXR`
3. Click `Play Mode OpenXR Runtime` and select `Other`
4. Enter the path to `openxr_runtime.json`
5. Run `aethervr_tracker.exe`
6. Enter play mode

### OpenComposite

AetherVR can be used to play SteamVR games by using [OpenComposite](https://gitlab.com/znixian/OpenOVR) as a translation
layer from OpenVR calls to OpenXR calls. You should be able to install AetherVR and OpenComposite on your system and it
should just work, though crashes are to be expected.

## Usage

See [this guide](docs/usage.md).

## System Components

### OpenXR Runtime

The OpenXR runtime (`aethervr.dll`) is a shared library written in the [Banjo programming
language](https://chnoblouch.github.io/banjo-lang/). It currently supports Windows and applications that use Vulkan or
D3D11 as their graphics API.

The runtime currently implements these extensions:

| Extension                                     | Version |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| XR_KHR_D3D11_enable                           | 9       |
| XR_KHR_vulkan_enable2                         | 2       |
| XR_KHR_win32_convert_performance_counter_time | 1       |
| XR_KHR_composition_layer_depth                | 6       |

### Tracker

The AetherVR tracker (`aethervr_tracker.exe`) is an application written in Python that uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Qt.
It tracks landmarks of the users head and hands using MediaPipe, converts them to virtual headset and controller inputs,
and sends them to the OpenXR runtime over TCP.
